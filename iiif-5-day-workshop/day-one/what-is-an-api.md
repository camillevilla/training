# What is an API?

Throughout the week, we’ll be discussing IIIF and its various APIs (Image, Presentation, and to a lesser extent, Authentication and Search). Before we dive into each of those specifications, let’s zoom out. An Application Programming Interface (API) can mean a lot of different things to different people, so we’ll establish a definition for the purposes of our workshop here.

Let’s begin with an example that has nothing to do with software.

## What's in a cup of coffee?

If I walk into a restaurant, I can usually expect to order from a menu. I tell the waiter or the person at the counter, “One cup of coffee, please!” I can generally rely on getting a cup of familiar brown / black liquid . There are certainly more details that go into making one cup of coffee, but I, the customer, and the person serving me the cup of coffee generally don’t need to chat about those details. For example, I don’t need to instruct the person to grind up the coffee beans first and then pour hot water on them. There are many ways a server might prepare the cup of coffee for me (e.g. a single pour over, an industrial coffee maker, ground up instant coffee, a French press), but they generally won’t discuss that with me.

## Reliable inputs and outputs
An API consists of an agreement between the API consumer (e.g. the person ordering coffee) and the API provider (the person serving coffee). Valid, correctly formatted inputs will produce valid, correctly formatted outputs. For example, if you asked for a cup of coffee and you received a bag of coffee beans, that wouldn’t be correct. If you received a cup of tea that would also be incorrect. The IIIF Framework consists of several useful agreements between institutions to serve up images and descriptions of those images in a reliable, compliant way.

## Conclusion
Why is this important? In the next section we’ll discuss the IIIF ecosystem and the problems it was designed to solve.
